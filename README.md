# Open Metaverse Interopability Protocol 

---

### NOTE: The metaverse is for everyone, therefore we believe anyone can add value. If you see an opportunity to improve our work, please dive in. Whether you can code or not, this is bigger than us all.

## The Open Inventory Project (need new name) is an open source protocol for sharing assets and items across the Metaverse.

With the accelerated creation of Metaverses and video games, we want to build an open inventory system that allows users to take their gear/loot with them.

Users can travel across worlds and level up their gear. When you buy a skin in a game, you can use it in other similar games. When you mint a starship you can use it in space themed games, etc.

We all love our loot. Sometimes that's 80% of the fun.

We'd like the repo to be open. Indy devs could run a simple npm i AngellXR/metaloot (or something like that) to access an open repo of assets for their games. Devs can set tags of what is and isn't allowed in their world.

This could really scale. Imagine owning your gear, and yes this works with NFTs but it could also be simpler than that for more generic items (like Assets you don't have to own).

My ask: I have been preaching this for nearly a decade and the time has come. I am ready to spearhead this project, but alas, I cannot develop it alone. I'd like it to be open source. I need help getting this kick-started so that it's not a product manager asking for developers, but instead, a community of creators working together.

The above is very much describing a User Interface that would use an federated Interoperability protocol. We are now working together to create that Protocol, which will be open source, and available for any other omni-verse or "metaverse" to utilize.

Once the protocol is live, in some form of baseline, we can create essentially two types of servers: Home and Content Servers

- content servers hold virtual worlds and items and such
  - Pepsi sponsored content, or an event, or a title game like Call of Duty would have a content server
- Home servers
  - spaces where people can sign up (like AngellXR / Webaverse / etc.)
  - Like allowing a user to choose their Crypto Wallet or Mastadon Server

This is an open source project. I am a Product Manager capable of helping, but this is much larger than me. I hope we can come together to create a more user-centered standard that empowers creators, and experiencers alike.

We are not looking to hyper focus on NFT's. NFT's (especially clean NFTs PoS) serve an ideal purpose for "owned" assets or swords that "level up" across different games and experiences. However, many assets won't require minting or ownership. A standard sword, or default starship for example may not require that level of ownership, and in some cases, may literally only call for a GLTF or even a png file (depending on the dimensions of course)

Please pull, submit PR's, and self-regulate as needed. AngellXR will prepare a backlog for us to work from once we get to our first alpha. I recommend keeping it simple and establishing a bseline for testing before getting any more complex than that.

If we choose to work together, we can achieve so much more. Thank you for your time.
