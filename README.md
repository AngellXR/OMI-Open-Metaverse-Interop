# Open Metaverse Interoperability Protocol

The Open Inventory Project (need new name) is an open source protocol for
sharing assets and items across the metaverse.

### NOTE:

The metaverse is for everyone, therefore we believe anyone can add value. If you
see an opportunity to improve our work, please dive in. Whether you can code or
not, this is bigger than us all.

## Open Inventory Project

With the accelerated creation of the metaverse and video games, we want to build
an open inventory system that allows users to take their gear/loot with them.

Users can travel across worlds and level up their gear. When you buy a skin in a
game, you can use it in other similar games. When you mint a starship you can
use it in space themed games, etc.

We all love our loot. Sometimes that's 80% of the fun.

We'd like the repository to be open. Indie developers could run a simple `npx
exec AngellXR/metaloot` (or something like that) to access an open repository of
assets for their games. Developers can set tags of what is and isn't allowed in
their world.

This could really scale. Imagine owning your gear, and yes this works with NFTs,
but it could also be simpler than that for more generic items (like assets you
don't have to own).

My ask: I have been preaching this for nearly a decade and the time has come. I
am ready to spearhead this project, but alas, I cannot develop it alone. I'd
like it to be open source. I need help getting this kick-started so that it's
not a product manager asking for developers, but instead, a community of
creators working together.

## Implementation

The above is describing a use scenario that would be built on top of a federated
interoperability protocol. We are now working together to create that protocol,
which will be open source, and available for any other metaverse platform to
use.

Once the protocol is live, in some form of baseline, we can create essentially
two types of servers:

- Home servers host:
  * Virtual worlds and items
  * Sponsored content
  * Events
  * Title games like Call of Duty
- Content servers host:
  * Sign-up locations
  * User accounts

Home servers allow the developers to provide content for the metaverse.
Content servers are similar to crypto wallets or Mastodon instances, and
allow a user to choose their own identity provider.

We are not looking to hyper-focus on NFTs. NFTs (especially
environmentally-friendly NFTs using proof-of-stake) serve an ideal purpose for
"owned" assets or swords that "level up" across different games and experiences.
However, many assets won't require minting or ownership. A standard sword, or
default starship for example may not require that level of ownership, and in
some cases, may literally only call for a glTF or even a `.png` file (depending
on the dimensions of course).

This is an open source project. I am a Product Manager capable of helping, but
this is much larger than me. I hope we can come together to create a more
user-centered standard that empowers creators, and experiencers alike.

Please fork, submit PRs, and self-regulate as needed. AngellXR will prepare a
backlog for us to work from once we get to our first alpha. I recommend keeping
it simple and establishing a baseline for testing before getting any more
complex than that.

If we choose to work together, we can achieve so much more.
Thank you for your time.
